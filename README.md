#### Notes
- You will need to have [dfx installed](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/#installing-dfx-via-dfxvm).
- Cycles coupon is good for 10T cycles, which is typically enough for deploying a frontend and backend canister.
- Recommendation: Do not deploy to the mainnet until your dapp is complete.
